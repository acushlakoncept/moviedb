Even though Bigg Boss 15 will only begin by September or October this year, makers have already kickstarted the audition process to get some ‘entertaining yet controversial’ commoners for the show. Talking about hosting Bigg Boss, Salman had earlier said, “Frankly, every year I feel like dipping out. Each year, I feel this is enough now but it has been a damn good journey, except for one or two contestants, who spoil everything. It is like you prepare kheer and someone sprinkles salt into it. They just mess things up, and more than that, they mess up their life which is the sad part of it. But it amazes me that I complete a decade on the show. So far, every time I think it is pushing too much and again, the next year happens.”",
